# Pole Climbing Robot

The Pole Climbing Robot is designed to perform inspection, surveillance, and maintenance tasks on vertical structures like utility poles and telecommunication towers. It features a stainless steel frame, geared DC motors, and a spring-based gripping mechanism for stable and efficient climbing on poles with diameters ranging from 70 mm to 120 mm. Powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, the robot supports both Bluetooth-controlled and non-Bluetooth operation modes, making it versatile and effective for various applications.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following folders:

1. **Bluetooth Controlled Robot**  
   This folder includes the code for operating the robot via a Bluetooth module. It allows wireless control using a mobile application or a Bluetooth-enabled device.

2. **Non-Bluetooth Robot**  
   This folder contains the code for operating the robot without a Bluetooth module. The robot is controlled through direct inputs, ensuring functionality without wireless communication.
